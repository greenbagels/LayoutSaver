# LayoutSaver

[![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/greenbagels/LayoutSaver?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/greenbagels/LayoutSaver/releases)

A program that saves your Windows desktop window layout, and restores it on command.

# Usage

Simply run the program, hit "Save" to record your current window layout, and "Load" to
restore windows to where they were.

Minimizing the program sends it to your notification
area, and double clicking the icon there will restore the window.

# Limitations

- The program does not persistently store any information, so closing it will lose data.

- The program has not been tested on older platforms, **but new issues are more than welcome**.

# Copyright
